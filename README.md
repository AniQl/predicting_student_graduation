<b> Task explonation </b>
<br>
You work as a data scientists at one of the top universities in the USA. One day a rector of the university comes to you with a task. She wants you to investigate the university’s admittance criteria and to create an engine that would recommend candidates with the highest probability of graduating. The university wants to maximise the graduate rates by enrolling only such students, because it is beneficial for both students and the university. Students get their degree, which makes it easier for them to start their career, and the university earns a tuition for the whole length of a program, as dropouts are minimised. 
You start your investigation by gathering two sets of data: 
● score_board.csv - contains candidates data with information on whether they were admitted or not; 
● graduates.csv - consists only of students data (so only those that started their education on the university are included) with information on whether they graduated or not. 
Columns definitions: 
● id - candidate id; 
● year - recruitment year; 
● gpa - Grade Point Average; 
● maths_exam, physics_exam, cs_exam, art_exam, language_exam - various exam results; 
● social_activity - score for the social activities (volunteering etc), values from 1-5, 1 means least active, 5 most active; 
● essay_score, interview_score - scores for an entry essay and an interview; 
● score - total score calculated to rank candidates; 
● accepted - whether a given candidate was high enough in a ranking to be accepted and whether they decided to use this opportunity; 
● graduated - whether a student graduated;
